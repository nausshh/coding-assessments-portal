In the proposed model we are taking the online examination system to a new level
by enabling The examinee to write descriptive answers which will get evaluated
on their own i.E automating

The entire offline examination system with the efficiency of computing having no
human error Involved, this can be done using NLP or natural language processing.

The evaluated answers will be stored in the database and they can be viewed
anytime and a particular student profile will be maintained for better evaluation of
the student.
